# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), where my goal is to learn TypeScript and familiarize myself with the conventions. Please don't hate if some or all code is non-idiomatic.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.14. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
